              visited, search queries, and general interaction patterns — all used exclusively to
              improve our services. We do not collect sensitive personal information unless you
              explicitly provide it (e.g., through a contact form).

              We may use third-party APIs — such as AlQuran.cloud or AlAdhan — to provide authentic
              Islamic content like Quranic verses and prayer times. These services have their own
              privacy policies. We are not responsible for the data collection practices of these
              external providers and encourage you to review their policies independently.

              information from unauthorised access, loss, or misuse. Our platform uses secure HTTPS
              connections and follows industry-standard security practices. However, no method of
              transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we encourage you to use our
              platform responsibly.
